Nmap has many built-in scripts designed to target a specific service and interact with it. 
Scripts can do all sorts of things like pull out information from the service or try to 
exploit it. We can enable the script scanner with the -sC flag. This enables only safe 
checks, as such no denial of service or exploitation attempts.
